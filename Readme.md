# MERN User Management Website

## Overview

This is a user management website built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to view, filter, search, and group users based on various criteria such as domain, gender, and availability status.

## Features

- **User Display**: Users are displayed in the form of cards, with 20 users per page and a total of 1000 users.
- **Filtering**: Users can be filtered based on their domain, gender, and availability status (available or not).
- **Search**: Users can be searched by their name.
- **Group Creation**: Users can create groups of users with unique domains and availability status.
- **Group Viewing**: After creating a group, users receive a group ID through which they can view group members based on the received ID.
